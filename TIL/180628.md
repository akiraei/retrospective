### server-side-rendering
  - for search engine to read contents of webpage made by single page application such like react
    - contents for open and searchable
    - not fit with closed and secret contents
  - SEO : search engine optimization
  - famouse tool: **'nextjs'**

### nextjs
 - standalone apllication
    - css, head related component, life-cycle, router
    - **do not another library or extention for above purposes - crash between**

### altenative of nextjs
- [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet)

### un-SSR-SEO: **Prerendering**
- positioning virtual browser(middle server) between search engine and server
- also need another server for virtual browser.
- it process diffrently request of man and requesr of engine 
- very delicate and difficult matter: decide phase of pages(site)
