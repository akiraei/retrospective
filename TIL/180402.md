## 1. Today I learned

### form _ label
- explit way : full script, universal
- inplit way : simple, limited

### form_placehorder

**placehorder**

- A hint to the user of what can be entered in the control . The placeholder text must not contain carriage returns or line-feeds. This attribute applies when the value of the type attribute is text, search, tel, url or email; otherwise it is ignored.
- Do not use the placeholder attribute instead of a `<label>` element. Their purposes are different: the `<label>` attribute describes the role of the form element; that is, it indicates what kind of information is expected, the placeholder attribute is a hint about the format the content should take. There are cases in which the placeholder attribute is never displayed to the user, so the form must be understandable without it.

### form_input
input type which is browser do not support ==> render `text` type

### form_date and calender, not only custom UI (not native)
- `<input type="month" />`
- if you use Jquary date plug-in(or not native UI), it could (and almost) do not support keyboard control.


### form_number
- `<output>` : catch value of `<input>` by script control.

### form_checkbox, radio
- complecate to do styling. 
- - solution: sync with img, label tag and button

### form_button(for submit)
- that button should be in fieldset tag which will be sent

## 2. Today I found out

### **`<input>` :after, :before**
`<input>` cannot make any children. so any :before and :after can't affect.
