### shrink display, image replace
- there is a button made by text node. you want to replace that button made by image tag when display is shrinked. one of solution is image replace by css property and media query.
- resolution of image is recommanded being double than box size which it will be in. in these days, high resolution display are widespread so if the image's resolution is standard ( x1 ), it will be blur for high resolution display.
